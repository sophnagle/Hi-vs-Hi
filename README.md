# Hi-vs-Hi

The is Project 2 in the SuperHi Experimental JavaScript course. Using Matter.js, I add a physics collision engine to the site to make the shapes collide, be dragged on click and hold and have gravity.

Friction is added to delay the speed of the fall of the images and cosine function added to gravity to control the direction which the images fall. 

The live project can be found here:

Here is the link to Matter JS:

Ideas taken from other engines too: 
Pts library
plank.js
Box2d

Images used from SuperHi

Note that MatterJS docs are not super clear and need to check rules and docs :)

## Debugging

Note that a user cannot right click, becuase of the click event that creates a shape.

Gravity orientation - this is not supported in Safari or apple ios. It is currently commented out but left for info [Orientation link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/deviceorientation_event)
