# Hi-vs-Hi

The is Project 2 in the SuperHi Experimental JavaScript course. Using Matter.js, I add a physics collision engine to the site to make the shapes collide, be dragged and have gravity.

https://brm.io/matter-js/ 

Ideas taken from other engines too: 
Pts library
plank.js
Box2d

Gravity orientation - this is not supported in Safari or apple ios. It is currently commented out but left for info
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/deviceorientation_event

## Project info

Colours

BLACK
#000000

WHITE
#ffffff

Note that MatterJS docs are not super clear and need to check rules and docs :)

## Debugging

Note that a user cannot right click, becuase of the click event that creates a shape.
